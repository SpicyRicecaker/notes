# History and Evolution of Javascript
## How Javascript was created
- Brendan Eich created it in 10 days
- Made HTML more interactive, assisted javascript so it had to look like it
## Standardizing Javascript
- Two standards are ECMAscript and ISO standard, created by 2 different organizations
- ECMAscript refers to standard while Javascript refers to lang
## Ecma Technical Committee 39
- TC39 develops javascript, made up of people from big tech companies
## TC39 Timeline/Process
- Was based on major versions before (up until es6) but is now a yearly release (es2019, es2020, etc.)

# Javascript
## Compatability Tables
- [Node]([Node](https://node.green/)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [ECMA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
## Why not remove old features?

- Javascript engines would have to support old and new versions
- Programmers have to know diffs
- Existing code bases have to be migrated or mixed

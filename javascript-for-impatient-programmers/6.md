# Syntax
## Basic
- `assert.equal(calculation, expected)`
  - You put the calculation on the left, and expected value on the right
  - For example, `assert.equal(1+1, 2)` would be true
  - *Node.js only*
- Objects
  - Did you know you can put a function inside of an object?
    + In this way, perhaps an object could be a class
- Arrays
  - *Also objects*
- Casing Styles
  - Camel case: helloWorldHi
  - Underscore case (aka snake case): hello_world_hi
  - Dash case (aka *kebab case*): hello-world-hi
    - Love this name!
- Capitalization of names
  - Lowercase
    - Functions, variables: myFunction
    - Methods: obj.myMethod
    - CSS:
      - CSS entity: special-class
        - I guess this means like class names
      - javascript variable for this class: specialClass
  - Uppercase
    - Classes: MyClass
    - Constants: MY_CONSTANT
      - You can also use camel case too i guess
- Other naming conventions
  - `arr.map((_x, i) => i)`
    - the `_` before the `x` in this case signals that the `x` isn't used
  - ```javascript
      class Bob {
      constructor(value){
      this._value = value;
      }
      }
      ```

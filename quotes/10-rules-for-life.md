[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2HIkR4aWxU)

## Growth vs Fixed Mindset
When you think that people are good because of talent versus putting in hard work

## MVP
80% of progress comes from 20% of the work

When you're working on a project, try focusing on making the core feature good at first and shipping it, rather than being preoccupied with a css layout or something

## Everything in Moderation
The generation 100 years from now will look back on us and laugh

What we think is true today may be completely different tomorrow, e.g. people thought that tomatoes were poisonous, when they were actually juicy

Therefore keep an open mind and take into account a view that you might not agree with, a good way to do this is to read books and keep on learning

## Success is Fun
If success is your end goal, then once you reach it you'll have peaked and it will be downhill from there

Many people keep setting their goalposts back and keep on working even if they're wealthy enough to retire

## Home is not a Place, Home is People
Material things don't matter as much as the connections you make with people, you won't find happiness in material things

## Nobody Cares
Try to experiment by acting funny irl, you'll realize that people don't actually care as much as you think they do

## Teach a Man how to Fish, rather than give him a fish
People are usually ungrateful of the material goods that you give them

Self-victimhood is a personality type

## Its not about the hand you're dealt, it's about how you play them

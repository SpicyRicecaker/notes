- Values
    - Positive trais you are choosing
    - Own values will change how we make that choice
    - Commenting on our own values relative to a different system
    - Change when we're doing something different
    - If community doesn't reflect values, software doesn't reflect values
    - You can't have it all
- Platform
    - Values are important but in tension
    - Want to balance all but have core principles
    - Attracts like-minded and becomes self-reinforcing
    - C
        - Higher level assembly
        - Simplicity, performance, portability, interopability
    - C++
        - Performance, portability, expressiveness
- Chally
    - For systems software, certain values hold
        - Performance
            - Is the root of all evil
            - Yet the thing we demand above all else
    - The values you build on you are dependent on 
- The system software disconnect
    - Divide between values held by programming languages and systems
    - We've managed, *despite* the programming language
- Rust
    - Safety, parallelism, and speed
    - Ownership, can determine when memory object is no longer in use
    - *Power* of garbage-collected lang, *Performance* of manual memory management
    - Highly composable, more sophisticated structs

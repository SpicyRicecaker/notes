- Glue work expected when you're senior
    - Risky when you're not (a senior)
- Tale of glue
    - Time spent mentoring and managing, instead of coding
    - Yet people really think that her work is good
    - You didn't get a lot of code done, so you don't get promoted
- Was it fair?
    - Didn't get better at coding,  yet did highest impact work
    - Manager never told her about her doing non-promotable work
    - Glue work is very important
    - If no women, dudes volunteered, otherwise they didn't
    - Large % of work should be what you're evaluated on 
    - Work evaluated based on peoples roles
    - Work that's non-promotable for anyone needs to be shared
- To manage or not to manage?
    - People say change your role instead of change your work
    - Code = better at coding
    - Manage = better at managing
    - *Vast majority of learning happens in your job*
        - Peopel in college don't apply to job
    - Choose a role that you're geniunely proud at
    - Taking non-engineering role will make people think you're not good at tech
    - Technical managers and project managers usually underestimated
    - > Not. Technical. Enough.
        - Not actionable feedback
- What to do when you're glue
    - Career conversation between PM and engineer
        - About promoting work
        - Honest answers, focus
    - Titles
        - Don't have to prove that you're good
    - Tell the right story
        - Publicly give appreciation for people that are glue
    - Give up, and only do the thing on the job ladder
    - If you make things not your problem, that's the only way you're able to free your calendar
- Learning and growing
    - Sheltering someone deprives them of learning opportunities
    - Don't do jobs that you can already do
    - You're good at some specific things, but you're also godo at everything you put your time into
    - Stepping back lets others get good at that thing

# Perilous Times ~ 03.1.2021

Things aren't going too well for me at the moment. I feel like the work I've had has never been higher than now, and I've never felt more trapped. I've blindly accepted an extension to my World History IA, but with it I have a Bell biology test coming up. Lit and TOK are both in the backburner as well, but I know sooner or later they'll start to scale really quickly. Wait, looking at this list, maybe there isn't so much after all...

## TODO

- [ ] Physics HW
- [ ] Bell Study Guide Notes
  - These often have absolutely nothing to do with any material on the quiz, so I don't get what the point of these are. But ok
- [ ] Study for Bell Test
  - C+ in Bio, accompanied by the fact that the quarter ends in a month and a half. If this test is failed, then there likely will be no A
- [ ] IB World History IA

## Afterthoughts

I guess I'm sad that I have so much less time than I did in the first semester to just enjoy my life... But I'm pretty sure that that's just an excuse --- I would've blown it all on Youtube anyways. I failed myself today: I got too far down the Youtube rabbit hole, and burned 5 hours. But today was also a success in many other ways: I was able to continue my exercise routine, get a lot of sleep, and work on the frontend, even if it was only for 2 hours. Currently, I have so much homework that is stacked on a 1 day due date schedule. I finish Bell notes and physics today, tomorrow I take the quiz and must finish the IA draft, and the day after that I've got TOK due, and the day after that I'm probably going to be down with more Bell homework.

Of course I _want_ to do my homework, but on the other hand I just can't bring myself to get started. I don't want to be hurt again, by another night of sleep lost. I don't want to have to face tomorrow, when I have to take a decisive BS test that determines my grade in the class. I guess I'm just scared of what it means for me to get back in touch with reality, and the consequences of...of doing what? Of living like I always have, of stalling on my homework to a sane degree and then putting in the effort for the final sprint, only to shoot myself in the foot again by spending that weekend doing nothing.

Maybe it just feels like I'm on constant overtime --- 5 hours and 20 minutes in school and another 6 hours getting my homework done. Through it all, I can't help but think of what my life would look like if I was a worker: would I my time like this, working overtime hours in job that I both love but hate with all my heart? Spending the weekend absorbed in a show and then coming back to do it all over again? Maybe the difference then, is that on the job I'll be doing something that I like. Because of course, that's what I'm going to college for --- in order to get this job that I both enjoy and something that pays well.

Maybe then, it's worth it to try hard in school, since it's not just good pay in a good job, it's also something that I'll enjoy. And a good college will also be helpful too.

But it just doesn't make any sense --- how can I want to do my homework, but at the same time, not want to do it at the same time, like me right now? The only conclusion then, is that these wants are based off of different values. Part of society tells me to pursue my passions, but the other part of society tells me to study hard. But after writing that sentence, I immediately doubt myself and am reminded of the fact that I spend my freetime being addicted to Youtube and unable to move at all. If I have freetime I am trapped, and yet if I pour everything into my studies I am trapped as well.

Maybe we should look then, into the past. Why was the past me able to complete my homework?

Immediately, the first answer to come to mind is that when I was younger, the world was more fair. Teachers actually took the time to explain the content. If you paid attention in class you would be able to do your homework. The work that was asked of you scaled to the amount of teaching done. I remember in 6th grade, where even scary teachers seemed to be kind and patient with kids, and I couldn't find fault with really any of them...why is it that the more I progress the less it feels like I'm happy of my success in school? Maybe that wasn't the right wording. It's just, responsibility is lumped on to you for no good reeason than the fact that you're getting older. Have I hit the classic high school difficulty spike and am whining like every other adult has once upon a time when they were kids?

The second answer that comes to mind are distractions. Back in first grade there was no all-consuming eater of time called Youtube. Just flash games and Plants v. Zombies. Back then I always did my homework...First grade diligently, second grade in class, third grade in class and at the recreation center, all the way up to 5th grade, where each day, looking back, all I can remember is the cool, air conditioned room next to the indoor tennis field and the hot humid air of the pool nextdoor and the leathery smell of the gym nearby.

I miss those days where people treated me as a kid and not as a bag of responsibilities ( I really shouldn't be reprimanding my brother at all then... )

## No more zero days

Amen. A long consistent string of nonzeros is what's important, much more so than a single day in which massive effort is put in. By that logic, don't even worry about the amount of work you put in, worry about if you're taking that step each and every day.

It's also a reoccuring theme:

## Your past, your present, your future self

Be grateful to your past self, and treat your future self as you would a best friend.

## Forgiveness

Forgive your past self for making mistakes

## Books and Exercise

There are many people who have figured it out before us and books allow us to tap into that knowledge. Exercise, there's too many benefits to count

## Goals

- CSS
  - [x] Reading Docs
  - [ ] Trying to implement something in Dribbly or Behance

#  `[ UPDATE: 0303 WED]` The day after the test
I feel like I'm just relieved everything is over. The day before the test I stayed up for the entire night --- well I guess not the entire night, playing around with essence of prompurr (esbuild, postcss, etc.) until 4:00 AM, then staying up for 4 hours and 30 minutes doing NOTES for the test. During the test, I felt like the test was actually justified relative to the content that we went over, but not to the actual endless notes that we had to do. After the day flew by (I was completely useless with 0 hours of sleep) I updated my git profile, then slept for 13 hours until now, then I got up at 8:21 realising that for some reason a bio discussion was due today at 8:30. Miraculously, my TODO list is still as long as ever:

## TODOS

- [ ] TOK subj + annotation: Just fill out the bliss paper 4head
- [ ] WH IA: Just read the first source
- [ ] Physics HW 14: Just read the textbook
- [ ] Lit Essay: Just read the article

## Things I want to do

- [ ] Exercise Routine
- [ ] The Demon Haunted World: 1 chapter
- [ ] Learn Rust: 1 chapter
- [ ] (That free js guide that seems really insightful): 1 chapter
- [ ] CSS (Docs): 1 section
- [ ] Behance/Dribble: 1 image, 1 circle
- [ ] Personal website / notes: json output
- [ ] Anki: 20 words from every section (that's it, let's start slow and carry on)
  - [ ] Japanese: (10 sakubi chapters, 1 new mining card)
  
Because of me staying up for so many nights, the lighting of my window makes me feel like I'm in the afternoon right now, with a full day gone by, even though it's only 10:43 AM. So I guess I have around 12 hours to do what I need to do and then sleep...

I guess things aren't so bad then. Bio is ok if I put effort in (this is me talking before I get quiz scores lol), I guess a the day before I was just mad because I remember the quizzes being completely unbalanced, and feeling like the effort I put in was futile. I just strangely out of it, but that's probably mostly from my busted sleep schedule.

## RWX Method
- Reading / Reviewing / Researching / Recognizing
- Writing / Wondering / Wishing
	- Deep Work
- Exercising / Executing / Experimenting / Examining / Explaining / Expanding
	- Experiments
		- Excercise.io
		- Experiment with something until you learn it, you know yourself better than anything else
		- Making your own plan, there's no one watching you
	- Examine
		- Getting good at assessing yourself
		- System is broken because it says that 92% is ok (some article at Khan Academy)
			- That 8% is really important, something that's lost everytime
		- Do it perfectly according to your own criteria
	- Lust of Knowledge
		- Act of creating is very 'lusty'
		- Thrill in art, but also feeling of 'mastery'
		- Become 'addicted to learning'
		- Few creators, lots of consumers
			- Some creators might enjoy creating more than consuming y'know?
	- (Repeat)
		- One thing that you have to learn, one thing that you want to learn
			- **SMART** You *have* to take attendence, but you don't *have* to automate it

## Preparing a plan
- Why are cruises so wonderful?
	- Not only physical but intellectual rest, because everything is scheduled and you don't have to think about anything
- Easy answers do not exist, there is no such thing as easy answers
	- You have to try and arrive at your own conclusions
	- 'Convenience is the death of cognition'
- How much time do I have?
	- Triathlon Training
	- Everybody has a different time managing method, find your own, everyone is different
	- Those who forgive themselves more quickly are more able to move on psychologically
- Plans
	- Either no plans or the plan is missing some part
- Comprehensive: Courses, Books, Walkthroughs
	- You find a well-established source that is highly-reputed
	- If you don't have comprehensive knowledge, you'll have 'gaps'
		- The goal of comprehensive learning is to fill your gaps
		- You can obliterate your imposter syndrome doing this
		- Oftentimes a book by an authority
		- Really hard work, really boring
	- Should you Certify?
		- Certificates cause Dunning-Krueger challenge
- Repetitive: Excercises, Recipes
	- Sprints, memorization things
	- Write a webserver from scratch 10 times
	- How quickly can you make a website from scratch
	- Flashcards
	- Use it or lose it
- Fun: Challenges, What-If, Competition, Gamified, Stuff you *Want* to make
	- Hacker challenges, etc.
	- However, none of them are comprehensive and fun
		- Exorcist tries to do it and fails?
	- 'The stuff that you want to make doesn't cover all the bases'
- At any moment in time it's easy to get bored, and watch netflix or play games
	- *Find what is fun for you* and stick with it
- Change it when you want
	- Forgive yourself for making mistakes, don't beat yourself up over it
- Drive your own curriculum
	- Afraid that someone will make the college look bad
	- Afraid that someone can't do the job so require a certificate
	- Human nature of community meets industrial testing

# Text Editors

## Emacs
- Plugins *and* configuration are required to make it usable


## Neovim
- Plugins are needed to make it function more like a modern IDE
  - `junegunn/vim-plug` makes installing most plugins a breeze
- Git
  - N/A

## VsCode
- Best out of the box experience
- Plugins
  - Point and click
- Vim Emulation
  - `vim`
    - Perfectly fine for small to medium sized projects
    - On a slow computer, on large files, or even just on occasion it breaks the workflow
  - `vscode-neovim`
    - Solid performance
    - Small visual issues, occasional breaking changes
  - Basically imagine an AAA game with great features that sometimes compromises on the basic feature of walking
- Performance
  - Unnoticeable on modern systems

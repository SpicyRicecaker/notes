# Time Management

## Cultural Views
- Northern European countries such as America have a *monochronic* time view, preferring to do one thing at a time
- Southern European countries such as Spain have a *polychonic* time view, preferring to do multiple things at one time
- Many Asian countries have a *cyclical* time view. In this time view the seasons are seen as repetitions of each other and time is not seen as wasted because it will come back later

## Creating an Effective Environment
- The timing of doing tasks is really important... tasks that require a high amount of mental energy should often be done in the mornings when one is refreshed
- ADHD can "cause a sense of underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through"

## 80-20 rule
- Pareto Principle
	- States that 80% of tasks can be done in 20% of the time, the other 20% can take up 80% of the time
- 80% of the productivity can be achieved by doing 20% of the tasks. 80% of the results can be attributed to 20% of activity
	- Less is more

## The Eisenhower Method
- There are two kinds of problems, important and urgent. Important problems are never urgent, and urgent problems are never important
- Eisenhower box/matrix
	- Important Urgent = Do immediately, personally
	- Important !Urgent = Schedule time, personally
	- !Important Urgent = Delgate someone else to do it
	- !Important !Urgent = Don't do it lol

## POSEC Method
- **P**rioritize your goals
- **O**rganize your things
- **S**treamline the stuff that you have to do
- **E**conomize things you should or like to do, but not urgent???
- **C**ontribute back to society
- Supposedly doing things higher up the hierarchy helps you do things better at the bottom

## Elimination of non-priorities
- If you have the habit of having good time management, then it only becomes easier for you

## Task list organization
- List out all the things you need to do and prioritize them
- Put the most unpleasant one first, after it's done the rest feel easier

# Procrastination
- Students
	- From western culture, students procrastinate because they are afraid that they might do worse on this work than work that they've done before, or because they feel guilting about not learning as much material as they should have
	- From eastern culture, students procrastinate because they are afraid of what their peers might think about their work
- Culture of time
	- In a multi-time view culture, people focus on getting the work done *right*
	- In a mono-time view culture, people focus on doing work for a specific amount of time and throwing in the towel after

## Etymology
	- Latin: procrastinare, pro : forward, crastinus : till next day, cras : tomorrow

## Prevalence
	- Temporal motivation theory
		- ```latex
		  Motivation = \frac{Expectancy\cdot Value}{1 + Impusiveness\cdot Delay}
		  ```
		- *Motivation* is the desire for a specific outcome
		- *Expectancy*, aka self-efficacy is the probability of success
		- *Value* is the reward associated with the outcome
		- *Impulsiveness* is the individual's sensitivity of delay
		- *Delay* is the time to complete that task
		- Magnitude * probability / 1 + time * constant
		- We can make the magnitude clearer by setting concrete goals, we can increase the probability by seeking help, we can decrease the time by setting small goal posts, and the constant comes from habit

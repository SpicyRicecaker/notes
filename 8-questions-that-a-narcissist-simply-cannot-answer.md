[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7qsxeQrKhg&feature=emb_rel_end)

## 1 What are some of your deepest hearts?
- Porn addition
  - Don't just say "no fap" or "I have a really high streak", admit your problem first, not just the solution
- Not treating my brother as well as I should
  - Don't say "my brother is annoying", family members have a huge impact on that

## 2 Why is it so Difficult to admit flaws and Mistakes?
- I don't admit my mistakes in League as much as I should
  - Even if your rank is higher, you should always be open-minded, and doubt if you're right
  - Difference between being confident 

## 3 Why do you feel the need to impress others?
- When I lose a nofap streak I act so confident
- I pretend like I know my brother and am nice to him all the time, when I spend most of my time on my own goals and ambitions
  - But I just don't enjoy playing with him what can I say
- I try to act cool when I'm going to school
  - Gotta move my hair slightly, speak politely
  - When it just takes so much effort to maintain that image
    - While for others they're just themselves and they don't care what others think
- I try to reinterpret past regrets anyway that I can to convince myself when they weren't as bad as they were
  - Even though, if I just admit those regrets, if I'm open about it
  - If I *tell* somebody about them, I think it completes that regret. But have I ever done that?

## 4 Why do my differences threaten you so much?
- I'm so bad at conversations
  - Opinions come out as statements
    - That's an interesting point of view, but what about my point of view?
      - Versus just asking about their point of view first!!
      - Why do you say that? What makes you say that? (Repeat their statement)
      - Listen to THEM more before placing your own opinions on the table
      - Don't be so eager to be the center of attention
- Inquiries come out as opinions
  - Other person says: I think chrome is good
    - Me: Doesn't chrome steal your privacy **though**?
- **I really need to do more listening and asking before even speaking a word of my own opinion, it's a really bad habit"**
  - *Try: not giving out any opinions for a week"*

## 5 Do you honestly believe your opinions...?
- They have such a high and lofty opinion of their life, "if you have something else, it's probably irrelevant"
  - If everyone asked and just listened, the world would be a better place

## 6 In what ways do you need to grow and change?
- Admit that your current condition came from a lot of failure, when people talk about the bad things they're facing talk about your own failures and encourage them
  - Don't only talk about your strengths, because it puts a huge shadow on everyone else

## 7 If I make you feel so frustrated, why do you keep coming back?
- I tell my brother to go away when I'm working, tell him he's annoying, and yet after my work's done I still go downstairs and ask him questions about where mom is or how his day is going
  - If I expect a reply then I myself must reply first, even if I'm in the middle of a tight schedule
  - Having a bad schedule is my fault in the first place, with literal 8% schooldays
- Conflict and strain makes narcissists feel superior

## 8 Why do you go silent?
- Leaving anger gives vulnerability

## Future
- They cannot access their interior
- I like being personal
  - My relationship with my brother is not well
- I like being accountable
  - Even if I agreed to do something on a whim (prank), if it backfires, I should still take responsibility for it
- I hope I never stop learning and growing
  - I hope so too
- I want to be free: no pretenses
  - I want set down my "10 ton shield" so I can focus on things that are really important to me
- Love me, love my dog
- Coming to terms with mistakes and failures, is part of growth
  - Acknowledging failure is really important
- We can love all of each other
- Life is simpler when we are not conniving
- We are each a combination of pluses and minuses
- Knowing, facts and impressions, vs knowing at the heart level
  - Really easy to ask "what's your grade" or, "did you do this", or "did you do that"
  - Really hard to ask people bout things you don't have any knowledge about
